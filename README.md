# autoencoder-workshop

Code for our autoencoder workshop. We walk through a detailed implementation of a basic autoencoder, and see how we can extend that to work on a slightly more real-world dataset, CIFAR-10. 

The slides for this workshop are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZHiViM6mxJuagKM1dIMbQzVzMJJAcNCRZQxEhYIlCWM/edit#slide=id.g35ed75ccf_022)
